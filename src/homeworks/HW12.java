/*        What is palindrome? - A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence
        of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.

        Create a JAVA program that allows you to enter a String value and gives you output if
        what you entered is palindrome or not. Make sure that your code will accept
        examples like this (“Anna”, “akA”) where some letters are uppercase they still are
        considered as palindromes. And also cases where some extra spaces have been
        passed (“  madam     ”, “           racecar”).
 Ask for user to enter a String value
 Create a for loop to check if first element of the String is equal to the last one
        and then second is equal to second from the end and so on until you have
        compared all of the elements.
 Create a logic that will make sure if all of the checks were true and in that
        case you can print that passed value from the user is Palindrome otherwise
        not.
 User printf formatting to get output similar to the examples below.*/
